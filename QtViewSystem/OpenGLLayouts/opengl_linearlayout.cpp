    // for a linear layout, we divide the size by the children count

    //23:16:40 Roughy: layout_weight is basically just the normalized weight * view size, except the weights kinda work in reverse so if you have 1.0 and 2.0 the 1.0 will take up 2/3rds'ish instead of the more logical opposite, if I Recall correctly
    //23:16:58 smallville7123: this is what i have at the moment
    //23:21:26 Roughy: if the weights made sense you'd just do ( weight / sum_of_weights ) * total_size_to_fill.
    //23:23:03 Roughy: in the case of Android's reversed weight values ( 1 - (weight / sum_of_weights ) ) I guess
    //23:26:01 smallville7123: so for example, if two views take up 50 each, and parent is 100, then
    //23:26:50 smallville7123: child_1.section = ( 1 - (childAt(0).weight / sum_of_weights ) );      child_2.section = ( 1 - (childAt(1).weight / sum_of_weights ) )
    //23:27:08 smallville7123: _section  *
    //23:28:47 Roughy: that should give you 0.5 for each of them. Multiply by 100 gives you 50 for each
